<h2 id="sh3" align="center">Why Trees are Important</h2>

<div style="margin:25px;">

<h2 id="sh3">1. Trees Regulate The Water Cycle</h2>

<p id="sp">The water cycle is the process by which water falls to the ground as rain. It’s then absorbed by trees and other plants, then released back into the air as transpiration.
Constantly ‘drinking’ whenever it can, a single tree will typically release around 250-400 gallons of water back into the air every single day.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">2. Trees Provide Jobs</h2>

<p id="sp">All the way from rainforest care to tree planting. From fruit harvests to biological and botanical research. Trees provide a multitude of jobs. At our project in Ghana, trees also offer the possibility of education for youngsters.
Working on the land is a career as old as time. But, as with many other physically taxing jobs, it tends to be work which is reserved for those in lower socio-economic areas.
</p>

<h2 id="sh3">3. Trees Are A Vital Habitat For Wildlife</h2>

<p id="sp">Surely we don’t have to explain the reasons why forests are vital for wildlife too?

A diverse range of birds, insects and mammals live in forest habitats. These creatures have adapted to their environment over centuries and are reliant on it.

While the larger or more exciting animals (elephants, tigers, gibbons, macaques, sunbirds or hornbills) may be the first that come to mind, a seemingly simple tree may well be home to hundreds or even thousands more creatures of a much smaller size. Snakes, frogs, millipedes, ants, termites, spiders, beetles, moths – all of them depend on the safety of their forest home.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">4. They Improve The Soil Quality</h2>

<p id="sp">Trees play a super important role in improving the quality of the soil around them in numerous ways. As part of their carbon filtering properties, they remove carbon and other noxious substances from the soil, allowing other plants to flourish.

Good quality soil should contain no more than 2% carbon. However, in heavily forested areas it can be as low as 0.05%. In fact, land that is surrounded by trees can double crop production thanks to the soil-purifying effect of trees. The better the yield, the less land is needed to feed humanity.

</p>

<h2 id="sh3">5. Trees Prevent Soil Erosion</h2>

<p id="sp">Areas that have been deforested are much more vulnerable to desertification. Using their trunks and foliage, trees form a natural barrier to winds and floods. This barrier slows the forces of nature down and helps to prevent bad weather from becoming a natural disaster capable of devastating large areas.

Philippines is one country where we focus on planting mangrove trees. These trees create a natural form of protection to the land.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">6. Trees As A Food Source</h2>

<p id="sp">Sustainably grown, trees are a source of so many vital foodstuffs. It is well known that the world’s population would have more than enough to eat if everyone followed a vegan diet.
We can get plenty of nutrients from trees alone. From nuts to fruits, to the syrup created from flowers and resins and the spices created from aromatic barks (cinnamon being one example). Trees are an amazing source of food for humans.

And hey – the firewood they provide enables us to prepare food we could otherwise not digest. One of the many reasons why trees are awesome is that they provide us with so many of life’s essentials.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">7. Trees Combat Noise Pollution</h2>

<p id="sp">As well as combatting air pollution, trees have a role in combatting the negative impact of noise pollution. A major effect of urbanisation, transport and industrialisation, noise is not just annoying for humans – it can have a devastating effect on wildlife.

Not only can the noise pollution caused by humans interfere with an animal’s sonar and navigation systems, it can disrupt whole ecosystems. For example, some breeds of nesting birds will not nest in habitats that are undesirable due to noise.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">8. And Light Pollution, Too</h2>

<p id="sp">As well as muffling sound, tree foliage also provides a barrier against unwanted light pollution.

Like noise pollution, as well as being annoying, city lights can disrupt the habits of animals such as birds and moths (as well as nocturnal mammals like badgers). They rely on the daily cycles of light and darkness to regulate their internal clock, navigate, and source food.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">1. Trees Regulate The Water Cycle</h2>

<p id="sp">The water cycle is the process by which water falls to the ground as rain. It’s then absorbed by trees and other plants, then released back into the air as transpiration.
Constantly ‘drinking’ whenever it can, a single tree will typically release around 250-400 gallons of water back into the air every single day.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">9. Trees Fight Climate Change</h2>

<p id="sp">One of the factors affecting global warming and climate change is the levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a ‘greenhouse’ gas, known for its heat-trapping properties. In a rapidly warming planet, the excessive levels of carbon dioxide that humans are producing is literally trapping the heat in our atmosphere.

As a tree grows, it absorbs carbon dioxide from the air through a process called photosynthesis. It stores the carbon as wood and releases oxygen molecules. For this reason, forests act like a giant filter. They remove the greenhouse gas from the air and only disperse it back into the air if they are burned, or decomposed back into the earth.</p>

<h2 id="sh3">10. Trees Create Oxygen</h2>

<p id="sp">There is truth in the saying that the Amazon rainforest is the green lung of our planet. We’ve already covered the way that trees remove CO2 from the air. It’s an additional bonus that they also produce oxygen as a bi-product. So not only do trees remove unhealthy air, they actually replace it with clean air.
Considering about two-thirds of the human body is made up of oxygen, that’s pretty good news for us! Without oxygen, it would be game over for the human species. And, since photosynthesis is the largest creator of oxygen, we should probably make sure we’re taking good care of our trees!
